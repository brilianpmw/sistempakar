          Dry skin is a common condition experienced by tons of people of all
          age ranges. It is the lack of water in the layer of skin, the
          epidermis. Scientifically, dry skin is known for the word Xerosis
          (Cole and Shiel Jr.).<br /><br />
          Change of age and hormone plays a big part in this condition. When a
          person is above fifty years old, they tend to get dry skin because
          there are tons of lost hormones. The causes of dry skin are section
          into two, from the outside and the inside of a human body. For the
          intrinsic factor, genetic and other diseases (which include diabetes,
          kidney failure, and more) most likely be the reason a person has dry
          skin. The genes of a person play a big part in their skin condition.
          The symptoms of dry skin are rough texture, itchy, may be red in color
          (Ulfa). <br /><br />
          To those who are experiencing these conditions, it is vital to check
          everything you do, especially things that have direct contact with
          your skin, which may include; fragrances, detergent, make-up, or even
          skincare. There are things you do every day that you aren't even aware
          of are a part of the problem's cause. It is crucial to know what your
          body is allergic to and, as said above, ask your family member if it
          is a genetic condition.<br /><br />
          If you endure a severe dry skin condition, Xerosis/dry skin itself is
          the base factor to what you faced. To know what dry skin condition
          occurs in your body, please kindly start to self-check-in on the
          "consultation" page. Thank you.
